# Keypirinha Dictionary
# A dictionary plugin for Keypirinha
This plugin uses the unofficial [Google Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to find definitions in [Keypirinha](https://keypirinha.com/).

## Usage
To use the plugin, first enter its menu by typing ``dictionary`` into Keypirinha, then enter the word you need the definition for.

All definitions provided by the dictionary will pop up, so simply select the one you need and press enter to copy it to your clipboard.

## Installation
Seeing as this package is, as of yet, not part of Keypirinha's convenient [PackageControl](https://github.com/ueffel/Keypirinha-PackageControl) plugin, you're going to have to download the ``Dictionary.keypirinha-package`` file from the Releases page of this repository into
- ``Keypirinha\portable\Profile\InstalledPackages`` if you're using Portable mode, or
- ``AppData\Roaming\Keypirinha\InstalledPackages`` if you're using Installed mode.

## Credits
- Thanks, first and foremost to the developers of the Google Dictionary API for the great API.
- Thanks Joe for the idea.
